## Week 4 Update

Basic POS and back-end setup is complete.  Successfully routed user authentication and login to the main page which contains the POS system.  I still need to complete the README.md and the database functionality which would allow each user to maintain their own POS system populated with their own saved settings.  I also need to re-setup gulp to automate installation procedures.  CSS also needs modifying to facilitate a better UI experience.

## Description
OpenPOS is a simple, open source web-based Point-Of-Sale System that features user authentication that is platform independent.  OpenPOS is built using the MEAN stack, a full-stack JavaScript framework:  

Node.js is an open source, JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side JavaScript code.  The platform is built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.  It is highly scalable and developer friendly nature.  In a nutshell, Node.js takes care of the back-end platform / web framework.  

AngularJS is an open source, JavaScript framework with the core goal of simplification.  It excels at building dynamic, single page applications (SPAs) while supporting the Model View Controller (MVC) programming paradigm.  In a nutshell, AngularJS takes care of the front-end framework.  

Express.js is an open source, JavaScript development framework that essentially acts as middleware.  It essentially provides URL routing among other various functionalities.  In a nutshell, Express.js supplements the back-end web framework.  

MongoDB is an open source, cross-platform document-oriented NoSQL database program.  It uses JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas (BSON) to persist data.  MongoDB is built for scalability, high availability and performance from a single server deployment to large complex multi-site infrastructures.  

Gulp is a command line task runner utilizing the Node.js platform.  It runs custom defined repetitious tasks and manages process automation.  

BrowserSync is an automation tool that synchronizes file changes and interactions across many devices.  This allows for faster development and better application testing procedures.
